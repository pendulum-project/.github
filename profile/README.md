The Pendulum project is building modern, full-featured implementations of the Network Time Protocol and the Precision Time Protocol. Pendulum focuses on security and robustness and provides memory safety through Rust.

Statime (PTP) and ntpd-rs (NTP) are the two projects that constitute Pendulum.

### Objectives

NTP and PTP are vital building blocks of the Internet and other critical infrastructure, running on millions of devices and servers. Our mission is to create memory-safe timing protocol implementations that 1) provide reliable time synchronization and 2) are easily extensible to accomodate future improvements of timing standards.

Working with the timing community and sharing our insights and knowledge is an integral part of that mission.

### Roadmap

- Q1 2023: NTS (Network Time Security) support in ntpd-rs
- Q2 2023: PTP default profile + NTP/PTP clock device
- Q3 2023: Adoption work (ntpd-rs) and new features 

Have a look at the [Statime](https://github.com/pendulum-project/statime) and [ntpd-rs](https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs) projects for more details about their roadmaps.

### Support us

Financial stability is key to maintaining and extending the projects and growing adoption. We offer GitHub sponsoring options and are happy to talk about custom sponsoring arrangements or funding for specific features.

### About

The Pendulum project is run by [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en).

We thank [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/) and the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) for their substantial support for the initial development.
