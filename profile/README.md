The Pendulum project is building modern, full-featured implementations of the Network Time Protocol and the Precision Time Protocol. Pendulum focuses on security and robustness, and uses the Rust programming language to guarantee memory safety.

Statime (PTP) and ntpd-rs (NTP) are the two projects that constitute Pendulum.

### Objectives

NTP and PTP are vital building blocks of the Internet and other critical infrastructure, running on millions of devices and servers. Our mission is to create memory-safe timing protocol implementations that 1) provide reliable time synchronization and 2) are easily extensible to accommodate future improvements of timing standards.

Working with the timing community and sharing our insights and knowledge is an integral part of that mission.

### Roadmap

- Q2 2023: PTP master in Statime + Adoption work for ntpd-rs
- Q3 2023: NTP/PTP clock device + Stable release ntpd-rs
- Q4 2023: PTP for Linux

Have a look at the [Statime](https://github.com/pendulum-project/statime) and [ntpd-rs](https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs) projects for more details about their roadmaps.

### Support us

The Pendulum project is run by [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en). We continuously seek the involvement of interested parties and funding for future work. Reach out to pendulum@tweedegolf.com if you're interested.

### Funders

We thank [Prossimo] and the [NLnet Foundation] for their substantial support for the initial development. 

In July of 2023, the [Sovereign Tech Fund] invested in Pendulum, securing development and maintenance for 2023 and maintenance and adoption work in 2024.
